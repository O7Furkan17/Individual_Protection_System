Real-Time Camera Image Attack Detection and Instant Alert System (Gerçek Zamanlı Kamera Görüntüsünden Saldırı Tespiti ve Anlık Uyarı Sistemi)

This project focuses on a system that detects firearms such as pistols, rifles, and sharp objects like knives from real-time camera images using artificial intelligence to provide instant alerts. The project integrates fundamental functions such as real-time image processing, running artificial intelligence models, and providing instant alerts.

Components of the attack detection and alert system include:
-> Transfer of image from IP camera to computer
-> Providing the obtained image as input to the trained model to detect firearms and sharp objects
-> Transmitting alerts to the necessary channels in case of detection of dangerous objects
