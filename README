This project focuses on a system that detects firearms such as pistols, rifles, and sharp objects like knives from real-time camera images using artificial intelligence to provide instant alerts. The project integrates fundamental functions such as real-time image processing, running artificial intelligence models, and providing instant alerts.

### Components of the attack detection and alert system include:
- ðŸ”„ Transfer of image from IP camera to computer
- ðŸ§  Providing the obtained image as input to the trained model to detect firearms and sharp objects
- ðŸ“¢ Transmitting alerts to the necessary channels in case of detection of dangerous objects

### Getting Started
To clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/O7Furkan17/Individual_Protection_System.git


If you want to run it on a PC default webcam:
>>run --mode 0

Otherwise:
>>run --mode "your camera IP"
